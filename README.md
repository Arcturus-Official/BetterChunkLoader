### BetterChunkLoader
This is a plugin fork for Cauldron-like MC1.7.10 servers that allows players to make chunk loaders.

This plugin requires [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/) and [BCLForgeLib](https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/BCLForgeLib), a server-side Forge mod library, so it can be added to any modpack without requiring the mod on client-side.
