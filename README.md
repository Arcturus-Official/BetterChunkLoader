### BetterChunkLoader
This is a plugin fork for Cauldron-like MC1.7.10 servers that allows players to make chunk loaders.

This plugin requires [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/) and [BCLForgeLib](https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/BCLForgeLib), a server-side Forge mod library, so it can be added to any modpack without requiring the mod on client-side.

If anyone is interested in contributing to BetterChunkLoader or has some ideas to improve the plugin, I would be more than happy to discuss it.

## Changes
- Option to set custom ID for Always only and Online only chunk loaders.
- Permissions
- Option to set limit in config or with permission node (betterchunkloader.onlineonly.number)
